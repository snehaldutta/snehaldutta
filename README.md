# 👋 Hey there, I'm Snehal!

I'm a Computer Science student who loves turning ideas into clean, scalable code. Whether it's building back-end systems or training ML models, I enjoy solving real-world problems with Python. I'm especially drawn to the space where **code meets data meets AI**.

## 🚀 What I’m Into

- 🛠️ **Python Back-End Development** – Building fast, reliable APIs with Django & REST.
- 🤖 **Machine Learning** – From research to real-world ML prototypes using PyTorch.
- ⚡ **Automation & Testing** – Speeding up workflows and writing tests with Pytest.
- 🧠 **Learning by Building** – Nothing beats getting hands-on with new tools and tech.
